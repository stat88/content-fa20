    "This homework consists of four problems. In these two problems, you will establish facts stated in Data 8. Remember properties of the expectation and variance of a linear function of a random variable. In both problems, you have a random pair $(X, Y)$ and $\\hat{Y}$ is the best linear predictor of $Y$ based on $X$. Question 3 and 4 are in Homework 13 Part II. **You need to complete both parts and make one single submission consists of all four questions on Gradescope to receive full credit**"
